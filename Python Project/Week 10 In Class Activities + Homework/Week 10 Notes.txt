Numerical - numerical values (numbers), salary
categorical - limited number of discrete values (category), gender, ratings
time series - temporal value (date, timestamp), finance
text - words, turn into no.

Finite summary set of data
Min, max, median, Q1 + Q3, quartiles

42, 20 ,31, 10 , 5, 3, 2, 1, 67, 53, 44

Step 1:
Arrange fr min to max, median in the center
Quartile, median of lower and upper set of no.

Features and Labels
Features
Intensity, tempo, genre, gender
Labels
Like, don't like

Tempo, Intensity
Extract features, and place data points on the graph
Formation of scatter plot

Feature, Record, Target, Label
k-nearest neighbours classication
confusion matrix

Record - each row
2 measurements - sepal length, petal length - features
Class - type of flower - target / label

k-nearest neighbours classification model
**The classification of a new record takes the majority of its k nearest neighbours**
1) 'nearest' - by distance on the graph
2) k is a parameter specified

Plot graph
k = 3, take the 3 nearest neighbours of the new record

How well does k-nearest neighbours perform on existing data

Divide data into two sets:
test set - know if k-NN wil predict the classifications here correctly
training set - the source of neighbours

Test set
Plot the test set, and the training set
Summarise the test result in the confusion matrix
